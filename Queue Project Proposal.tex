	For the purposes of improving the effectiveness an efficiency of providing support to students form STIMulate's IT stream, we have proposed that a system be implemented to keep track of students looking for support. This queuing system will allow Duty Hosts to record which students are looking for support in the areas provided by the IT stream (though this may be expanded to allow the Maths and Science streams to access the system) and individual PLF's will then be able to get a better sense of what people need their help than deciphering a crowded table.
	\newline
	\newline
	The team developing this project, being part of the target audience, will be able to get accurate data from our peers and can directly test the effectiveness while the product is in development.
	\newline
	\newline
	Ideally this would be developed as an addition to the existing STIMulate website, and while possible according the Connor McLaughlin, there has been no word as of yet as to whether people not contracted by QUT will be able to access the sever it is housed on.
